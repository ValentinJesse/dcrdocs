## Purchasing FLO

### Exchanges

One way to acquire FLO is to purchase some on an exchange.
Since the release of FLO on June 2013, four
cryptocurrency exchanges have added support for FLO (last updated December 2017).

* [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange/#btc_flo)
* [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-FLO)
* [Nova Exchange](https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_FLO/)
* [BarterDEX](https://komodoplatform.com/en/technology/barterdex/)

If you need help obtaining Bitcoin to get started, the process is well documented in the [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_Bitcoins_%28the_newbie_version%29).

## Mine for FLO (PoW)

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a measure of using computational power to
create and verify the cryptographically secure blockchain.  This is
similar to traditional Bitcoin mining. You can mine for FLO at the following mining pools:

* [Alexandria](https://api.alexandria.io/pool/)
* [Suprnova](https://flo.suprnova.cc/)
* [Aikapool](https://aikapool.com/flo/)
* [Italyiimp](http://italyiimp.com/explorer/FLO)
* [TheCoin](https://flo.thecoin.pw/)

## Contribute to FLO

FLO is currently recruiting contractors - members of the community who are paid in FLO for their contributions. Come to our [forum](https://forum.flo.cash/) and tell us what would you like to contribute with.

## Sell / Trade Goods or Services for FLO

An alternative to obtaining FLO is to use your skills, knowledge,
or experience by exchanging services for FLO as payment.  Services
can be anything that you are skilled at which are in need or
requested by other members of the FLO community.
